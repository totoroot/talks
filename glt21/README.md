# Gotta Collect 'Em All

## Metrics Easily Visualised

My talk about metrics collection on Linux using [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) given at [Grazer Linuxtage](https://www.linuxtage.at/en/) 2021.

> **Note**: Due to COVID concerns this event took place online. I was invited to a BigBlueButton online conference room and only had the option to present my slides rendered as PDF.


### Presentation

In this repository you'll find the contents of my talk in Markdown format, the assets I used (including the custom reveal.js Dracula theme I created) as well as the presentation rendered in PDF format. You'll also find the resulting HTML presentation.

The presentation itself was made with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

You can find some more information on how to navigate the interactive HTML version of the slides on my website:

If you want to create stunning, interactive presentations yourself, I recommend you take a look at [reveal.md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), which makes a lot of things a bit easier. All that is needed to start is a Markdown file with some front matter.

> **Note**: My face was very puffy and I struggled opening my mouth while talking, as I just had surgery on my upper and lower jaw in February of 2021 and had not yet fully recovered.
